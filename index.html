<h2>Secured and Encrypted.</h2>

<div class='title'>End-to-end encryption</div>

<p class='desc'>
End-to-end encryption means messages are encrypted before they leave your device using a secret key.
Even if someone is monitoring your network, or someone hacks our relay server, they would be unable to decipher your messages.

<p class='desc'>
Easy uses encrypted websockets (TLS) to establish a secure connection between participants, and encrypts your messages once more during transmission.

Easy messages are only routed in real-time to the recipient, and never stored or saved in a database. Once a message has been delivered, there's no record of that message ever being sent.
Conversations on Easy mimick real life conversations: if you're not there when they said it, they'll have to repeat it once you get there.

<h2>What's Easy?</h2>
<p class='mt-40'>
<strong>Easy makes it easy to create a 1-on-1 secure chat room using your Terminal.</strong>
</p>
<p>Easy does away with the complexities of modern day secure chatting applications:</p>
<ul>
<li>
It has no remote message storage system, which means a message vanishes without a trace after it's delivered.
</li>
<li>
Encryption keys are set per-room, which means Easy doesn't have to deal with the usual complexity of issuing, managing, and securing keys. Instead, keys are communicated via a secure means of your choosing (in person, secure phone, password hint).
</li>
<li>
Easy uses high-entropy encryption "sentences" to encrypt messages. Instead of using random strings, you'll use easy-to-remember but impossible-to-guess passphrases like "the quick yellow dog jumped in the cold blue water".
</li>
<li>
Easy doesn't have a complicated UI that slows down messaging and communication.
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Advanced Usage</h2>
<p>To begin using Easy, just type <code>easy</code> after you've installed it. That should be all you need. The following custom options are available:</p>
<p>
<strong>Launch Arguments</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li><code>e</code> or <code>email</code>: sign in with a different email than the one saved. Example: <code>easy e=hello@standardnotes.org</code></li>
<li><code>logout</code>: ends login session</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>Chat Commands</strong>
When you're in a chat room, you can use these commands:
</p>
<ul>
<li><code>:set-secret</code>: change the room encryption key</li>
<li><code>:show-secret</code>: show the room encryption key</li>
<li><code>:server</code>: print the address of the server you're connected to</li>
</ul>
<p class='mt-40'>
<strong>Using Your Own Server</strong>
<p>
By default, Easy uses the secure server avaialble at https://api.easy.gd for both user authentication and websocket broadcoasting.
To use your own server, set the following environment variables before launching Easy:
</p>
</p>
<ul>
<li><code>EASY_SERVER</code>: Authentication server address.</li>
<li><code>EASY_SOCKET</code>: Socket server address.</li>
</ul>
Both the authentication server and socket server are available as one Ruby application that you can clone from
<a href='https://github.com/easychat/server' target='_blank'>GitHub.</a>
